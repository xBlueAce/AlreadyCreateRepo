# Already Created REPO

this is what to do in the case a repo has already been created..

## Turning into a git repo

we use 
->git init

*insert photo *


and if we use git status we see there nothign that has been committed
 -> git status

 *insert Photo*


so then we go ahead and add 
 -> git add .
 -> git add README.md 

 either or can do

 *insert photo*

 now we commit

## be careful

now let's try pushing to git hub
via git push
we get an error

 * insert photo *

So to fix this we create a empty repo on git hub.

then 
->git remote add origin *insert repo*

*insert photo here

and it set up

now we push via
->git push origin master
