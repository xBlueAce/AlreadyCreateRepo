# Already Created REPO

this is what to do in the case a repo has already been created..

## Turning into a git repo

we use 
->git init

*insert photo *


and if we use git status we see there nothign that has been committed
 -> git status

 *insert Photo*


so then we go ahead and add 
 -> git add .
 -> git add README.md 

 either or can do

 *insert photo*

 now we commit to github
